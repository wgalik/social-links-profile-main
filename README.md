# Overview

# My process

Built with:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS (Sass) for modular and maintainable styling
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- Responsive design using clamp()
- Google Fonts (Inter)
- Mobile-first workflow

What I learned

This project helped me practice using SCSS variables, mixins, and nesting to keep styles organized and reusable.
I also learned how to create clean, minimal components with hover transitions and responsive card layouts.

# Useful resources

[Sass Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/)
– Helped me understand nesting and mixin syntax.

[MDN – clamp()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp)
– Useful for making text and spacing responsive.
